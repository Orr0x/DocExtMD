# LM Studio Troubleshooting: Why Q8_0 Won't Load

## üîç Current Situation

- ‚úÖ **docling-q4_0.gguf** (198MB) - Working perfectly in LM Studio
- ‚ùå **docling-q8_0.gguf** (396MB) - Not loading in LM Studio

## üõ†Ô∏è Most Likely Causes & Solutions

### **1. Memory Requirements** (Most Common)
**Problem**: Q8_0 quantization requires significantly more RAM/VRAM

**Symptoms**:
- LM Studio shows "Out of memory" or "CUDA out of memory"
- Model loads partially then crashes
- Very slow loading or hangs during initialization

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check available memory
wmic OS get FreePhysicalMemory /Value
wmic OS get TotalVisibleMemorySize /Value

# Or use Task Manager > Performance tab
```

**LM Studio Settings**:
- Reduce context size to 2048-4096 tokens
- Use CPU-only inference if GPU memory is insufficient
- Close other applications to free RAM

### **2. Model Architecture Compatibility**
**Problem**: Some GGUF implementations have metadata LM Studio doesn't recognize

**Solutions**:
- **Update LM Studio** to latest version
- **Try different loader**: Use "Load with GGML" instead of "Load with GGUF"
- **Check model integrity**: Verify file isn't corrupted

### **3. Quantization-Specific Issues**
**Problem**: Q8_0 might have specific encoding that older LM Studio versions don't support

**Solutions**:
- **Use Q4_0** (already working perfectly)
- **Try Q5_0** if you need higher quality than Q4_0
- **Downgrade expectations**: Q4_0 actually performs excellently for document tasks

## üìä Performance Comparison: Q8_0 vs Q4_0

| Aspect | docling-q8_0 (396MB) | docling-q4_0 (198MB) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Quality** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Speed** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Memory Usage** | High (600-800MB) | Low (300-500MB) |
| **LM Studio Compatibility** | ‚ùå Problematic | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **File Size** | 396MB | 198MB |

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### **Stick with docling-q4_0** because:

1. **‚úÖ Proven Working**: Already loads perfectly in LM Studio
2. **‚úÖ Excellent Quality**: Minimal quality loss vs Q8_0 for document tasks
3. **‚úÖ Memory Efficient**: Much lower RAM/VRAM requirements
4. **‚úÖ Speed**: Faster loading and inference
5. **‚úÖ Reliability**: No compatibility issues

### **If you MUST use Q8_0**:

```bash
# LM Studio troubleshooting steps:
1. Close LM Studio completely
2. Restart your computer
3. Open LM Studio
4. Go to Settings > Advanced
5. Reduce context size to 2048
6. Try CPU-only mode first
7. Load the model with minimal settings
```

## üîß Advanced Troubleshooting

### **Check Model File Integrity**
```bash
# Verify file size matches expected
dir models\docling-q8_0.gguf

# Expected: ~396 MB
# If significantly different, re-download
```

### **LM Studio Logs**
- Check LM Studio logs for specific error messages
- Look for "GGUF", "memory", or "architecture" related errors

### **Alternative Model Sources**
If Q8_0 continues to fail, consider:
- **docling-q5_0.gguf** (248MB) - Middle ground
- **docling-q6_k.gguf** (298MB) - K-quantization (often more compatible)

## üí° Why Q4_0 is Actually Better for Your Use Case

For **document processing and Markdown extraction**:

- **Q8_0 differences are negligible** for text-heavy tasks
- **Q4_0 speed advantage** is significant for API usage
- **Memory efficiency** allows running more models simultaneously
- **LM Studio stability** ensures reliable operation

## üèÜ Bottom Line

**Keep using `docling-q4_0`** - it's the optimal choice for your document processing needs:

- ‚úÖ **Works perfectly in LM Studio**
- ‚úÖ **Excellent quality for document tasks**
- ‚úÖ **Fast and memory-efficient**
- ‚úÖ **Reliable and stable**

The Q8_0 compatibility issues are common with larger quantized models. Your Q4_0 model provides nearly identical quality with much better LM Studio compatibility.
